# Deviation Requests

This directory contains requests to deviate from the established plan as required by WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md.

## Purpose

When the current plan needs to be changed, a formal deviation request must be:
1. Documented here
2. Reviewed and approved
3. Tracked for historical purposes

## File Naming Convention

Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-[task-or-topic-name].md`

Examples:
- `2026-01-22-yaml-to-json-change.md`
- `2026-02-01-reorder-phase2-tasks.md`
- `2026-02-15-add-testing-requirement.md`

## Required Information

Each deviation request must include:
- Current plan details
- Proposed change
- Justification
- Impact analysis
- Alternatives considered
- Approval decision (once reviewed)

See WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md for the full template.

## Approval Process

1. Create deviation request file
2. Create GitHub issue referencing the request
3. Tag repository owner/maintainer
4. Wait for approval/rejection
5. Update request file with decision
6. If approved, update relevant plan documents

## Active vs. Archived

- **Active:** Requests pending approval
- **Approved:** Requests that were approved and implemented
- **Rejected:** Requests that were rejected (kept for historical context)

Move files to subdirectories once decided:
- `deviation-requests/approved/`
- `deviation-requests/rejected/`

**Note:** NO deviations are permitted without approval documented here.
