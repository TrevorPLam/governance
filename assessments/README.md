# Task Assessments

This directory contains pre-execution assessments for tasks as required by WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md.

## Purpose

Before starting any task, a thorough assessment must be documented here to ensure:
- The task is sound given the current repository state
- Prerequisites are met
- The approach is validated
- Dependencies are understood

## File Naming Convention

Use the format: `phase-[N]-task-[N.N].md`

Examples:
- `phase-1-task-1.1.md`
- `phase-2-task-2.3.md`
- `phase-3-task-3.7.md`

## Template

See WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md for the assessment template.

## Review Process

1. Create assessment before starting task
2. Document findings and decision
3. Reference assessment in commit messages
4. Keep assessments for historical record

**Note:** Assessments are required for compliance with sequential task execution workflow.
