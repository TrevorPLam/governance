## 📈 Maturity Progression

The implementation follows a maturity model progression:

| Phase | Status | Maturity Level | Capabilities |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Phase 1-2 | ✅ Complete | Level 1 (Basic) | Policies defined, framework exists |
| Phase 3 | ✅ Complete | Level 2 (Managed) | Tools enable automation, CI/CD integration |
| Phase 4 | ✅ Complete | Level 2-3 (Managed-Defined) | Documentation enables adoption, examples demonstrate value |
| Phase 5 | ⏸️ Not Started | Level 3 (Defined) | Advanced features, metrics-driven, highly automated |
| Phase 6 | ⏸️ Not Started | Level 4 (Optimizing) | Continuous improvement, data-driven decisions, community-driven |

**Current Maturity Level:** Level 2-3 (Managed-Defined)  
**Next Target:** Level 3 (Complete Phase 5)
| Phase 6 | Level 4 (Optimizing) | Continuous improvement, data-driven decisions, community-driven |

---

## 🎯 Critical Path Items

Must complete in order (dependencies):
1. **Phase 1** → Must complete before Phase 2 (folder structure needed)
2. **Phase 2** → Must complete before Phase 3 (framework needed for tools)
3. **Phase 3** → Must complete before Phase 4 (examples use tools)
4. **Phases 1-3** → Must complete before Phase 5 (foundation for advanced features)
5. **Phases 1-5** → Must complete before Phase 6 (need everything for polish)

Can parallelize (after Phase 2):
- Some Phase 4 documentation can start during Phase 3
- Phase 5 planning can happen during Phase 4
- Community infrastructure (Phase 6) can start anytime
